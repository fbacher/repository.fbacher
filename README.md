<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8' />

This project (repository.fbacher) creates an un-official Kodi Addon Repository to be used
to simplify the installation and update of Kodi TTS (service.kodi.tts) while it is
under development and not in the Official Kodi Repository. 

See [build readme](http://smeagol/repo/README_BUILD.html) for more information
