# Overview
This site provides a private Kodi addon repository that simplifies installation
and update of the Kodi TTS addon which is currently in Alpha. By installing this
repository addon you will be able to easily install Kodi TTS and any dependencies.

NOTE: At this time Kodi TTS is ONLY available on Windows and Linux. Once this release
is complete, it will be a priority to add more platforms.

Although not required, it is suggested that you install the **mpv** player first. You need
it on Linux, but is optional on Windows if you use the Navigator's voice engine. However,
without mpv you won't be able to try out Google TTS voices. Also, mpv is more responsive
than the built-in player.

If you think that you will want to use eSpeak, go ahead and install that now as well, so 
that it can be used as soon as you install Kodi TTS.

If you choose not to install mpv or eSpeak, you can install them later.

## Install Optional Programs

Although optional, it is suggested that you install mpv and perhaps eSpeak-NG.

To install **mpv** or **eSpeak-NG**
Choose your platform:
  * [Install on Windows](https://feuerbacher.us/repo/INSTALL_WINDOWS_PROG.html) 
  * [Install on Linux](https://feuerbacher.us/repo/INSTALL_LINUX_PROG.html) 

## Install Kodi addons

You will next install a Kodi Repository addon. This is needed since the TTS addon is still
in development and not available in the official Kodi Repository. After this private 
repository is installed you will be able to use it to install the latest available TTS 
addon as well as updates in the future.

## To begin the installation

Choose your platform:
  * [Install on Windows](https://feuerbacher.us/repo/INSTALL_WINDOWS.html) 
  * [Install on Linux](https://feuerbacher.us/repo/INSTALL_LINUX.html)
