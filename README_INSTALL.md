    * You can either install the repository as an Kodi addon
    OR
    * You can download and install the individual zip files required by TTS.

The advantage of installing the repository addon is that you won't have to repeat coming to this
site to download then install the .zip files

The advantage of not using the repository addon is that some people don't like
using unauthorized repositories.

### To Use the Repository

First download the TTS Repository addon's .zip file
[from here](http://smeagol/repo/zips/repo.fbacher/repo.fbacherREPO_ZIP_VERSION)

Next, install the repository as you would any Kodi Addon:

In Kodi, go to **Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on browser -> Install from zip file**.
There will probably be a warning about installing from unofficial sites. Select to
allow the installation. Select the .zip file that you downloaded from the previous step.
After installation, the repository **fbacher.develop** should show up in Kodi's
**Install from repository** dialog.

Finally, install the **Kodi Screen Reader** addon from that repository. Dependent addons will be automatically
installed.

### Installing Without the Repository

If you prefer not to use the TTS Repository, you can download and install the two addons
**LangCodes** and **Kodi TTS** (in that order) from the zip files:

  * [LangCodes](http://smeagol/repo/zipsLANGCODES_ZIP-LANGCODES_ZIP_VERSION)

  * [Kodi TTS](http://smeagol/repo/zipsTTS_ZIP-TTS_ZIP_VERSION)
