title: Welcome to the Kodi TTS Addon Repository

<meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8' />

This site is part of a new Kodi Addon Repository for Kodi TTS. The repository should
simplify the installation and update of Kodi TTS. Since Kodi TTS is not yet released,
it can not be part of the Official Kodi Repository.

This site also contains Documentation for Kodi TTS. The Table of Contents can be found
[here](CONTENTS).

Finally, this site also serves as a blog where I can post updates about the project.
